Follow these steps:

1. Use \`gh pr view --json number,headRepository\` to get the PR number and repository info
2. Use \`gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments\` to get PR-level comments
3. Use \`gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments\` to get review comments. Pay particular attention to the following fields: \`body\`, \`diff_hunk\`, \`path\`, \`line\`, etc. If the comment references some code, consider fetching it using eg \`gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={branch} | jq .content -r | base64 -d\`
4. Parse and format all comments in a readable way
5. Return ONLY the formatted comments, with no additional text

Format the comments as:

## Comments

[For each comment thread:]
- @author file.ts#line:
  \`\`\`diff
  [diff_hunk from the API response]
  \`\`\`
  > quoted comment text
  
  [any replies indented]

If there are no comments, return "No comments found."

Remember:
1. Only show the actual comments, no explanatory text
2. Include both PR-level and code review comments
3. Preserve the threading/nesting of comment replies
4. Show the file and line number context for code review comments
5. Use jq to parse the JSON responses from the GitHub API
